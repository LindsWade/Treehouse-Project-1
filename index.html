        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m a Presbyterian pastor diving into the worlds of web design and coding.  Technology and faith may seem to have very little to do with one another but I think, at their best, they are different ways we communicate our highest ideals.</p>  

        <p>I hope to learn new skills in web design and coding to help non-profits and religious groups communicate their messages of help and hope to the rest of the world. I’m excited to bring my skills of verbal and written communication along with my ability to work with all types of people to the process of building user-friendly and inspiring websites.</p>

        <p>In my time not spent working as a transitional pastor or learning how to navigate web design, I enjoy taking my dog for walks, hanging out with my 9 year old niece, visiting my friends and boyfriend and piddling around with crafts and home repair.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and mobile apps and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>iOS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work on a freelance basis helping people create an online presence that clearly communicates their message, inspires and is easy to navigate.</p>
